Experiments were performed in the burnt gases of premixed methane/argon/oxygen flames with seeded NO (15 to 50 ppm), pressures of 10 to 60 bar, and an equivalence ratio of 0.9. LIF signals were dispersed with a spectrometer and recorded on a 2-D intensified CCD array yielding both spectral resolution and 1-D spatial resolution. This method allows isolation of NO-LIF from interference signals due to alternative species (mainly hot O2 and CO2) while providing spatial resolution along the line of the excitation laser. A fast data analysis strategy was developed to enable pulse-by-pulse NO concentration measurements from these images. Statistical analyses as a function of laser energy of these single-shot data were used to determine the detection limits for NO concentration as well as the measurement precision. Extrapolating these results to pulse energies of ∼ 16 mJ/pulse yielded a predicted detection limit of ∼ 10 ppm for pressures up to 60 bar. Quantitative 1-D LIF measurements were performed in CH4/air flames to validate capability for detection of nascent NO in flames at 10–60 bar.","tags":[],"title":"Yoo_detection_2008","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Test post\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"ef6f966c97cdd4a9383ff0282697f419","permalink":"https://jihyungy.github.io/post/new-post/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/new-post/","section":"post","summary":"Test post","tags":null,"title":"Test post","type":"undergraduate"}]
