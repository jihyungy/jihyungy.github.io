Flame stabilizing mechanisms were experimentally examined using OH, CH, and CH2O planar laser induced fluorescence (PLIF) of premixed CH4 and air flames at operating equivalence ratios between 0.7 and 1.2. A quantitative measure of flame stability was obtained through dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) analysis of high speed OH-PLIF images. Lean blow off limits and emissions were also characterized across a wider range of equivalence ratios to better understand mesoscale burner array combustion characteristics. Lastly, combustion experiments using liquid fuel, pentane (C5H12), were also carried out.

Proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) is used to postprocess data and extract information on flame dynamics that are usually lost through classical statistical approaches. POD analysis carried out on OH planar laser-induced fluorescence images reveals that even at coupled plasma powers corresponding to less than 5% of the thermal power output, significant improvement in mean energy content of flames ( 23%) was observed. The corresponding decrease in heat release fluctuations resulted in improved combustor flame dynamics and flame stability, which was found to be in good agreement with acoustic pressure measurements. In the presence of plasma discharge, an effective decoupling between the flame oscillations and the fluid unsteadiness was established due to the differences in flame stabilization mechanisms resulting in up to 47% reduction in root-mean-square pressure fluctuations. Thus, effective fluid-acoustic decoupling in addition to the accelerated combustion chemistry due to the nonthermal effects of plasma led to significantly improved combustor dynamics, namely, decreased heat release and pressure fluctuations.","tags":[],"title":"Proper orthogonal decomposition for analysis of plasma-assisted premixed swirl-stabilized flame dynamics","type":"publication"},{"authors":["J Yoo","N Traina","M Halloran","T Lee"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1464739200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1464739200,"objectID":"a9e739ee9060baedcd7f68a8ef660da3","permalink":"https://jihyungy.github.io/publication/yoo_minute_2016/","publishdate":"2019-08-23T10:27:57+09:00","relpermalink":"/publication/yoo_minute_2016/","section":"publication","summary":"Minute concentration measurements of simple hydrocarbon gases are demonstrated using near-infrared supercontinuum laser absorption spectroscopy.

Two main ideas in planar laser-induced fluorescence (PLIF) diagnostics are explored in this thesis. The first topic is the development of a single-shot PLIF diagnostic technique for quantitative temperature distribution measurement in shock tube flow fields. PLIF is a non-intrusive, laser-based diagnostic technique capable of instantaneously imaging key flow features, such as temperature, pressure, density, and species concentration, by measuring fluorescence signal intensity from laser-excited tracer species. This study performed a comprehensive comparison of florescence tracers and excitation wavelengths to determine the optimal combination for PLIF imaging in shock tube flow applications. Excitation of toluene at 248nm wavelength was determined to be the optimal strategy due to the resulting high temperature sensitivity and fluorescence signal level, compared to other ketone and aromatic tracers at other excitation wavelengths. Sub-atmospheric toluene fluorescence yield data was measured to augment the existing photophysical data necessary for this diagnostic technique. In addition, a new imaging test section was built to allow PLIF imaging in all regions of the shock tube test section, including immediately adjacent to the side and end walls. The signal-to-noise (SNR) and spatial resolution of the PLIF images were optimized using statistical analysis. Temperature field measurements were made with the PLIF diagnostic technique across normal incident and reflected shocks in the shock tube core flow. The resulting images show uniform spatial distribution, and good agreement with conditions calculated from the normal shock jump equations. Temperature measurement uncertainty is about 3.6% at 800K. The diagnostic was also applied to image flow over a wedge. The resulting images capture all the flow features predicted by numerical simulations. The second topic is the development of a quantitative near-wall diagnostic using tracer-based PLIF imaging. Side wall thermal boundary layers and end wall thermal layers are imaged to study the temperature distribution present under constant pressure conditions. The diagnostic technique validated in the shock tube core flow region was further optimized to improve near-wall image quality. The optimization process considered various wall materials, laser sheet orientations, camera collection angles, and optical components to find the configuration that provides the best images. The resulting images have increased resolution (15um) and are able to resolve very thin non-uniform near-wall temperature layers (down to 60um from the surface). The temperature field and thickness measurements of near-wall shock tube flows under various shock conditions and test gases showed good agreement with boundary layer theory. To conclude this thesis, new applications and future improvements to the developed PLIF diagnostic technique are discussed. These suggested refinements can provide an even more robust and versatile PLIF imaging technique capable of measuring a wider range of flow conditions near walls.","tags":[],"title":"Strategies for planar laser-induced fluorescence thermometry in shock tube flows","type":"publication"},{"authors":["J Yoo","D Mitchell","DF Davidson","RK Hanson"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1285891200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1285891200,"objectID":"37c22656d98944d8386accee9142cad9","permalink":"https://jihyungy.github.io/publication/yoo_planar_2010/","publishdate":"2019-08-23T10:12:19+09:00","relpermalink":"/publication/yoo_planar_2010/","section":"publication","summary":"The planar laser-induced fluorescence (PLIF) imaging method was used to perform flow visualization and quantitative planar thermometry in shock tube flow fields using toluene as a fluorescence tracer in nitrogen. Fluorescence quantum yield values needed to quantify PLIF images were measured in a static cell at low pressures (1 bar) for various toluene partial pressures in nitrogen bath gas. Images behind incident and reflected shocks were taken in the core flow away from regions affected by boundary layers. Temperature measurements from these images were successfully compared with predicted values using ideal shock equations. Measured temperatures ranged between 296 and 800 K and pressures between 0.15 and 1.5 atm. The average temperature discrepancies between measurements and the predicted values behind the incident and reflected shocks were 1.6 and 3.6%, respectively. Statistical analyses were also conducted to calculate the temperature measurement uncertainty as a function of image resolution. The technique was also applied to the study of more complex supersonic flows, specifically the interaction of a moving shock with a wedge. Measured temperatures agreed well with the results of numerical simulations in all inviscid regions, and all pertinent features of the single Mach reflection were resolved.","tags":[],"title":"Planar laser-induced fluorescence imaging in shock tube flows","type":"publication"},{"authors":["T Lee","WG Bessler","J Yoo","C Schulz","JB Jeffries","RK Hanson"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1220227200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1220227200,"objectID":"3954e562f9ce272f4a7ad4d4cdd923ea","permalink":"https://jihyungy.github.io/publication/lee_fluorescence_2008/","publishdate":"2019-08-23T09:57:16+09:00","relpermalink":"/publication/lee_fluorescence_2008/","section":"publication","summary":"The fluorescence quantum yield for ultraviolet laser-induced fluorescence of CO2 is determined for selected excitation wavelengths in the range 215–250 nm. Wavelength-resolved laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) spectra of CO2, NO, and O2 are measured in the burned gases of a laminar CH4/air flame (φ=0.9 and 1.1) at 20 bar with additional NO seeded into the flow. The fluorescence spectra are fit to determine the relative contribution of the three species to infer an estimate of fluorescence quantum yield for CO2 that ranges from 2–8×10−6 depending on temperature and excitation wavelength with an estimated uncertainty of ±0.5×10−6. The CO2 fluorescence signal increases linearly with gas pressure for flames with constant CO2 mole fraction for the 10 to 60 bar range, indicating that collisional quenching is not an important contributor to the CO2 fluorescence quantum yield. Spectral simulation calculations are used to choose two wavelengths for excitation of CO2, 239.34 and 242.14 nm, which minimize interference from LIF of NO and O2. Quantitative LIF images of CO2 are demonstrated using these two excitation wavelengths and the measured fluorescence quantum yield.","tags":[],"title":"Fluorescence quantum yield of carbon dioxide for quantitative UV laser-induced fluorescence in high-pressure flames","type":"publication"},{"authors":["J Yoo","T Lee","JB Jeffries","RK Hanson"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1209600000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1209600000,"objectID":"eefb7fdaa21a69989a259bf75a961552","permalink":"https://jihyungy.github.io/publication/yoo_detection_2008/","publishdate":"2019-08-23T09:57:16+09:00","relpermalink":"/publication/yoo_detection_2008/","section":"publication","summary":"Spectrally resolved laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) with one-dimensional spatial imaging was investigated as a technique for detection of trace concentrations of nitric oxide (NO) in high-pressure flames. Experiments were performed in the burnt gases of premixed methane/argon/oxygen flames with seeded NO (15 to 50 ppm), pressures of 10 to 60 bar, and an equivalence ratio of 0.9. LIF signals were dispersed with a spectrometer and recorded on a 2-D intensified CCD array yielding both spectral resolution and 1-D spatial resolution. This method allows isolation of NO-LIF from interference signals due to alternative species (mainly hot O2 and CO2) while providing spatial resolution along the line of the excitation laser. A fast data analysis strategy was developed to enable pulse-by-pulse NO concentration measurements from these images. Statistical analyses as a function of laser energy of these single-shot data were used to determine the detection limits for NO concentration as well as the measurement precision. Extrapolating these results to pulse energies of ∼ 16 mJ/pulse yielded a predicted detection limit of ∼ 10 ppm for pressures up to 60 bar. Quantitative 1-D LIF measurements were performed in CH4/air flames to validate capability for detection of nascent NO in flames at 10–60 bar.","tags":[],"title":"Detection of trace nitric oxide concentrations using 1-D laser-induced fluorescence imaging","type":"publication"}]
